## Overview
### Description
Like Rate My Professors, but with clubs! This web service allows users to create and view clubs, add and view ratings, and search and filter clubs based on category or name. This application is for a semester-long group project in CS 4800 - Software Engineering at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Review App / Academia
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for desktop but is just as viable on a mobile device.
- **Story:** Displays clubs for users to click on to view the club page. From there, logged in users can add ratings to that particular club.
- **Market:** The target audience is college students who want to view and rate clubs.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wants. Users who are not logged in can view clubs, but cannot create ratings.

## Deployment
The web service was deployed on Heroku, but the free tier was removed. Below are the demo gifs instead.\
